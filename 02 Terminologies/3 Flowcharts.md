# Flow Charts

## Introduction
Flow charts were widely used in the era of monolithic programming, and later during procedural programming. With the rise of object-oriented and aspect-oriented programming, the use of flow charts has diminished. However, flow charts are still a valuable tool for visualizing the flow of control in a program.

## Purpose of Flow Charts
A flow chart helps represent the flow of control in a program. It illustrates the sequence of steps the program follows, which is especially useful when dealing with large programs. Instead of reading through complex code, one can look at the flow chart to understand the programâ€™s behavior.

**Analogy**: Just like a wiring plan in a house helps trace the flow of electricity, a flow chart shows how different parts of the program are connected and how they interact with each other. Without a flow chart, you would need to "dig" through the entire program to understand how it works.

## Components of a Flow Chart
Flow charts are made up of various shapes and symbols. Some of the key elements include:

1. **Ellipse**: Represents the Start and Stop points.
2. **Parallelogram**: Used for taking input and displaying output.
3. **Rectangle**: Represents a processing step.
4. **Diamond**: Used for decision-making (condition).
5. **Arrows**: Show the flow of control.

## Flow Chart Structure
Flow charts are typically structured into three basic steps:
1. **Input**: Data that the program will process.
2. **Process**: The operations that will be performed on the input data.
3. **Output**: The result produced after processing the data.

### Example 1: Flow Chart for Adding Two Numbers
1. **Start**: The flowchart begins.
2. **Input**: The program asks the user to enter two numbers.
3. **Process**: The program adds the two numbers.
4. **Output**: Displays the sum of the two numbers.
5. **Stop**: The flowchart ends.
