# Steps Involved in Development and Execution of a Program

## Overview
This blog discusses the essential steps in the development and execution of a program. These steps are not repeated each time but should be used consistently when writing a program.

### Key Steps
1. **Editing**
2. **Compiling**
3. **Linking Libraries**
4. **Loading and Execution**

## Editing a Program
Editing refers to typing out the program. The program can be typed using any text editor, but editing alone is not sufficient. After editing, the program needs to be compiled, linked, and executed. Therefore, it is easier to perform all these actions in one place using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

### What is an IDE?
An IDE integrates all the necessary tools for writing, compiling, linking, and executing a program. Some popular IDEs include:
- **Turbo C++**: Works for both C and C++.
- **Dev C++**: Supports both C and C++.
- **Xcode**: Mainly used on macOS.
- **Codeblocks**: Cross-platform IDE.
- **Eclipse**: Supports multiple programming languages.
- **Visual Studio**: Developed by Microsoft.

Some IDEs are specific to programming languages (e.g., Turbo C++ for C/C++), while others, like Eclipse and Visual Studio, support multiple languages.

### Choosing an IDE
- **For beginners**: Dev C++ is recommended.
- **For macOS**: Xcode or Codeblocks is suitable.
- **In colleges (India)**: Turbo C++ is commonly used for teaching C/C++.

## Compiling the Program
After editing the program, the next step is compiling it. Compiling converts the source code (e.g., `first.cpp`) into machine-readable code (e.g., `first.exe` on Windows). If there are no errors, the compilation will generate an executable file.

### Steps:
1. **Write and save the program** in an IDE.
2. **Compile** the program using the IDEâ€™s compiler.
3. If no errors are found, the compiler generates an executable file (`.exe` for Windows).

## Linking Libraries
To make the program functional, various built-in code elements or libraries are used. These libraries provide ready-made functions for tasks like:
- Reading input from the keyboard
- Printing output to the screen
- Saving data to a file
- Mathematical operations (e.g., sine, cosine, logarithms)

### Library Files in C++
- **Header Files**: Contain the declarations of functions or classes.
- **Library Files**: Contain the pre-compiled machine code for these functions or classes.

Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>  // Header file for I/O functions
