# What is a Program and Why Do We Write Programs?

## Understanding Programs
- A **program** is a set of instructions that a processor (CPU) can understand and execute.
- Computers use **binary language** and predefined instructions to perform tasks.

## Purpose of Writing Programs
- To perform **computational tasks** (tasks that can be done using pen and paper).
- Examples:
  - Using formulas to calculate values.
  - Performing repetitive or complex calculations efficiently.

## Why Computers Over Calculators?
- **Simple tasks** like adding two numbers can be done using calculators.
- **Complex tasks** like finding the average of multiple numbers require a **procedure**:
  1. Sum all the numbers.
  2. Count the total numbers.
  3. Divide the sum by the count to get the average.

## Procedures in Programming
- Procedures involve a sequence of steps to solve a problem.
- Calculators lack the ability to learn or understand procedures.
- Computers can be programmed to execute these procedures automatically.

## Programmable Devices
- A **computer** is an extension of a calculator.
- It is a **programmable computational device** capable of:
  - Following predefined steps (procedures).
  - Performing tasks efficiently with minimal user intervention.

## Key Concepts in Programming
1. **Data**: The input or information to process (e.g., numbers in a list).
2. **Instructions**: The steps or operations to perform on the data.

## Defining a Program
- A program is a collection of:
  - **Data**: Information to work with.
  - **Instructions**: Set of operations to process the data.

## Example: Finding the Average
1. Input the list of numbers (e.g., `10, 15, 8, 6, 9, 5, 12, 13, 11, 16`).
2. Sum the numbers (`105`).
3. Count the numbers (`10`).
4. Divide the sum by the count to get the average (`10.5`).

## Why Learn Programming?
- Programming enables computers to perform complex tasks without manual intervention.
- It is the foundation of creating applications, solving problems, and automating processes.
